                     <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                     <P>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                        It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival.</P>
                             <P>Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. 
                                They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns.</P>

                            <p>Gemsbok live in herds of about 10â€“40 animals, which consist of a dominant male, a few nondominant males, and females. They are mainly desert-dwelling and do not depend on drinking water to supply their physiological needs. They can reach running speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph). 
                                    Gemsbok are mostly crepuscular in nature, since temperatures are tolerable and predator detection rates are highest during these times.</p>
                                       <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                                       <p>You will find the gemsbok just beyond panda canyon.</p>
